Experiment 1:  
Baseline LED stream with no concept drift and different class proportions tested with incremental multinomial NB and VFDT classifiers with undersampling buffer on and off.

Experiment 2:
LED stream with concept drift (in class proportions) tested with incremental multinomial NB and VFDT classifiers with undersampling buffer on and off.
